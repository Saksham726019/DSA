30
I started this assignment on October 8. First, I read the whole instructions three times, making sure I understood the requirements. Then the next day, I completed the reading input part, where I took at least 3 hours because we had to implement pointers pointing to pointers, which was quite confusing. However, the total time it took me to finish was around 15 hours, where I spent most of my time in "Missing letter at beginning or end" and "Extra letter at beginning or end", trying to fix the segmentation fault due to simple null termination index error. I also spent quite some time in comparing the output generated by "auto" and my "main", which helped me find a very subtle mistake. When using "add", I was inserting into dictionary before printing. I did not attend office hours due to time conflict.
