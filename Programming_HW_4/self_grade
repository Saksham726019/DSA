I started to read the instruction on November 7. I read the whole instructions 5 times at least, making sure I understood the requirements.  November 8 and 9, I crammed two whole days and completed the assignment (with extra credits for decoding). I crammed two whole days because from Novermber 11, I will be busy wih co-op interviews. I spent quite few hours on why my huffman tree is not giving same order and binary code as the one given in starter package. Then I asked in discord and Andrew replied saying "it will be different from person to person as long as compression stats is same". I felt stupid for not asking sooner, but it is what it is. I learned a valuable lesson. However, I will be submitting on the deadline day because I will be testing the code making sure it's correct completely. I did not attend office hours due to time conflict.
