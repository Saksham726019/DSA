I started to read the instruction on November 21. I completed the solvable part in like 3 days. I even ran out of memory while doing the unsolvable board becaus I didn't realise we could use google's help to figure out the inversion technique to check if the boad is solvable or not. So, I went to office hours, talke with Andrew and even Professor Yusuf and I was recommended two things: Linked-List for Queue and inversion technique. I implemented the inversion technique. Then, I also spent 4-5 hours trying to fix the memory leak issues. Morever, I spent quite some time to make the code run fater. Such as: memcmp() to compare boards instead of using for loop, emptyTile pointer in BoardState struct instead of searching emptyTile for every board, reducing the usage of mallocs. I also tried static inline but didn't make much difference.
